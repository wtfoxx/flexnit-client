# Flexnit
Flexnit is a single page app that uses state routing and a responsive UI library for a seamless, smooth experience. The app provides movies from a dedicated API and allows users to view information about the movies, Directors and Genres, and add/remove Movies to a list of favorites. New users are able register, registered users can login, interact with the app and logout.

New users can register safely as all passwords are hashed before being stored in the database so anyone with access to the users database won't know anyone's password. With that said, emails only use the @ sign to validate, so you don't have to use your personal email for this.
